# Tivaan Vision – AI-Powered Vehicle Detection and Accident Prevention

### Overview
Tivaan Vision integrates aerial vehicle detection (YOLOv8) with wearable-based safety systems to reduce accidents and enhance road safety in India. This project combines Deep Learning and IoT in an innovative, affordable ecosystem.

### Milestone 2 – Deep Learning Model Training
Includes:
- Dataset: DroneVehiclesDatasetYOLO
- YOLOv8 Model Training Pipeline
- Evaluation (Precision, Recall, mAP)
- Inference Outputs and ONNX Export

### Run Steps (VSCode)
1. Open project in VSCode.
2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
